# Web-Based Inventory Management System With Smart Analytics For Hardware Stores

Inventory is a highly significant asset for any business. Efficiently managing inventory is essential for the smooth functioning of businesses, particularly for hardware stores dealing with a wide variety of products. But even though we are in a time where there is a lot of modern technology, there are local hardware businesses that depend on manual inventory systems, causing them to face various issues and challenges.



The study aims to develop a Web-Based Inventory Management System (IMS) with Point of Sales (POS) module which supports multiple functions for a generic system.
