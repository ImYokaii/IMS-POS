# Stockord: An Inventory Management System for Local Hardware Stores

Inventory is a highly significant asset for any business. Efficiently managing inventory is essential for the smooth functioning of businesses, particularly for hardware stores dealing with a wide variety of products. But even though we are in a time where there is a lot of modern technology, there are local hardware businesses that depend on manual inventory systems, causing them to face various issues and challenges.

Stockord is an inventory management system specifically designed for local hardware stores.
